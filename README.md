# Styling-React-Components-Using-Multiple-Approaches


### Project purpose :

Building web apps with React is not just about composing components together and making sure that the logic works correctly,but building React apps is also about styling those apps to make sure that they look good.


In this demo app I used different techniques for setting styles dynamically and for styling components such that other components are not affected by a specific component's styles.


In this app I showed how to set up styles in a conditional or dynamic way and how to switch certain styles based on some conditions.
