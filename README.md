# Styling-React-Components-Using-Multiple-Approaches


### Project purpose :

Building web apps with React is not just about composing components together and making sure that the logic works correctly,but building React apps is also about styling those apps to make sure that they look good.


In this demo project I used different techniques for setting styles dynamically and for styling components such that other components are not affected by a specific component's styles.


In this app I showed how to set up styles in a conditional or dynamic way and how to switch certain styles based on some conditions. 

I worked with styled components approach, which is a third-party library that allows us to set up pre-styled components with their own scoped styles. I also worked with CSS modules approach.
